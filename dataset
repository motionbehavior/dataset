We collected motion sensor data by using wearable devices. There are totally 20 subjects consisting of 10 male and 10 female subjects.
In total, we obtained 300 right hand samples and 300 left hand samples from the 20 subjects. For each subject, we have 15 samples of 
walking data sensed by the MSBand on the right hand and another 15 samples from the MSBand on the left hand of the subject.
Every data sample consists of two files: one is the 3 dimensional acceleration data and the other is the 3-dimenional angular velocity 
data.
